Accumetra is making available a revised version of the open source Lesion Sizing Toolkit, now called 
ACM-LSTK (stands for Accumetra Lesion Sizing Toolkit). The initial LSTK project was started and led 
by Rick Avila, with funding from the Office of Naval Research and the NIH National Library of Medicine,
was made available to the open source medical imaging community as a module within the Insight 
Segmentation and Registration Toolkit (ITK). The original LSTK project was designed to be a flexible 
architecture for experimenting and implementing volumetric lesion sizing algorithms (e.g. CT small lung 
nodules). The original LSTK team included Xiaoxiao Liu X., Brian Helba, Karthik Krishnan, 
Patrick Reynolds, Matthew McCormick, Wes Turner, Luis Ibáñez, and Rick Avila.

This new ACM-LSTK version has been improved to include a much higher performance CT small lung nodule 
volume measurement algorithm. Notably, the small nodule segmentation algorithm has been improved to 
calculate a sub-voxel nodule segmentation boundary.

Prerequisites for compiling ACM-LSTK are the following libraries:
* ITK version X
* VTK version Y
